TUT_INTRO_TEXT: <<|
	[i][/i]"在帝国历史的第四十个世纪，崭新的纪元即将到来，新的星系与殖民计划，
	正如火如荼，世界各地的人们满怀热情与抱负，来到帝国的边缘地区。至少新闻
	里是这么说的……"

TUT_INTRO2_TITLE: 纪元 3876 年: 人类帝国
TUT_INTRO2_TEXT: <<|
	[i][/i]"事实上，这里是个汇聚了亡命之徒、犯罪分子与律师的污水沟，帝国被迫频
	繁的派遣舰队以维持秩序——舰队假借防范修西奥人入侵的借口，被派往无
	人认领的空间站、定居点。

	当然这种以暴制暴的秩序与安定，截止到帝国舰队离开，就再次消亡了。殖
	民地将再次陷入抢劫、残忍的谋杀与集体诉讼中，难以休止。

	面对这样的痼疾，大多数行星舰队的指挥官彻底失去了改革边境的信心……"

TUT_INTRO3_TITLE: 纪元 3876 年: 人类帝国
TUT_INTRO3_TEXT: <<|
	[i][/i]"但我必须为【119舰队】的霍普指挥官而骄傲。

	他是我们的指挥官, 致力于边境的稳定与发展，甚至并不介意采用最激进
	的手段达到目的。准将已经前往这颗星球上最大的城市，与定居者讨论改
	革计划和条件。

	霍普阁下在成行后不久，就死于痢疾——希望他真的是死于痢疾。

	回归主题，你成为了这支队伍的新指挥官。"

TUT_FTL_TITLE: 返回基地
TUT_FTL_TEXT: <<|
	我们所保护的殖民地：[b]Lihls 行星[/b]位于邻近的星系。无论那儿发生了什么，
	我们都必须去找当地居民们谈谈了。

	这个距离可不近，如果靠亚光速前进，估计我们就要先考虑后事了。
	来试试我们旗舰上的超光速推进装置吧，消耗 FTL 储备，把我们传送过去。
>>
TUT_FTL2_TITLE: 返回基地
TUT_FTL2_TEXT: <<|
	Use of all methods of FTL travel is limited by the availability of
	[color=#00c0ff][img=ResourceIcon::3;20/] FTL Energy[/color]. This energy is
	harvested through use of special tuning crystals, found on only a few
	planets in the galaxy, and then superluminally transmitted to the ships
	authorized to use it.

	迁跃的距离越远，消耗的 FTL 储备就越多。命令舰队使用超光速推进装置，
	这应该不会耗尽你的 FTL 储备。

TUT_ARRIVE_TITLE: Captain's Log
TUT_ARRIVE_TEXT: <<|
	"Arriving at the colony, we held a brief funeral ceremony for our commodore
	- now posthumously promoted to Rear Admiral. The local undertaker had done
	a good job covering the charred laser wound on his forehead.

	It was decided that the fleet would continue to support the settlement and
	its expansion into the local area of space until the Terran Empire
	officially claimed the region."
>>

TUT_RES_TITLE: Resources
TUT_RES_TEXT: <<|
	Most planets in the galaxy contain the natural resources to produce
	a single particular type of resource in quantities large enough for
	a sustained export industry.

	Resources range from food and water, to supercarbons and uranium, to FTL
	crystals. Not every resource can be produced right away, and some resources
	require a higher [b]level[/b] planet in order to produce.
>>

TUT_LEVEL_TITLE: Expanding and Developing
TUT_LEVEL_TEXT: <<|
	Every settled planet has a [b]level[/b], ranging from level 0 to level 5.
	Planet levels indicate the amount of infrastructure, population and
	development a planet possesses, and higher level planets are better in many
	ways.

	In order to level up a planet, it requires access to more and more
	resources, imported from different planets. For example, level 1 planets require [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::3;22/] Food and [img=ResourceClassIcons::4;22/] Water[/b].
>>
TUT_LEVEL2_TITLE: Expanding and Developing
TUT_LEVEL2_TEXT: <<|
	When you export a resource, the original planet no longer has access to
	that resource for its own use.

	Because planets require resources from other planets to level up, not every
	planet can be a high-level powerhouse. It is important to carefully choose
	which planets to send resources to, and which higher level resources to
	start producing.

	In our case, we want to level up Spacewood to level 2 to gain extra income
	and population.
>>

TUT_EXPAND_TITLE: Colonizing and Exporting
TUT_EXPAND_TEXT: <<|
	To reach [b]Level 2[/b], Spacewood requires a [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::0;22/] Tier 1 resource[/b]
	(such as [template=resource_ref;NativeGold/]) and another [b]Food[/b] (such as [template=resource_ref;Grain/]).

	[b]Select[/b] Spacewood and [b]right-click[/b] a planet you wish to colonize, and choose 'Colonize with Spacewood.'
	You may also [b]right-click[/b] the planet on its own and choose 'Colonize This,' which will automatically choose a planet to colonize with.
>>
TUT_EXPAND_ACT1_TITLE: Colonize a Food Resource
TUT_EXPAND_ACT1_TEXT: <<
	Colonize a nearby [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::3;22/] Food[/b] planet.

TUT_EXPAND_ACT4_TITLE: Export the Tier 1 Resource to Spacewood
TUT_EXPAND_ACT4_TEXT: <<
	Queue the export of the [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::0;22/] Tier 1 Resource[/b] resource to spacewood by left clicking and dragging from the source planet to spacewood.
>>

TUT_LEVELREQS_TITLE: Planet Level Requirements
TUT_LEVELREQS_TEXT: <<|
	Next, we'll need to upgrade two planets. Each planet level has a growing need for more resoures of different tiers. Every planet requires a source of [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::4;22/] Water[/b], and each level requires an additional [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::3;22/] Food[/b]. On top of these, higher levels have need of a number of [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::0;22/] Tier 1[/b] and [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::1;22/] Tier 2[/b] resources.

	At any time, you can check what types of resources a planet will need to upgrade by [b]selecting[/b] the planet and looking in the bottom left, or by [b]double-clicking[/b] a planet and checking the bottom left panel.
>>

TUT_IMPORT1_TITLE: Upgrading Planets
TUT_IMPORT1_TEXT: <<|
	Your new planet must reach [b]Level 1[/b] to produce and export its [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::0;22/] Tier 1 Resource[/b]. To reach level 1 and use its resource, we must import a [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::3;22/] Food[/b] and a [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::4;22/] Water[/b] resource from other planets.

	Resources can be exported anywhere within your [b][color=#8888ff]Empire[/color][/b] border. Your [b][color=#999999]Trade[/color][/b] border shows systems that will become tradeable once colonized. [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::4;22/]Water[/b] is available nearby in [b]Odatak[/b].
>>
TUT_IMPORT1_ACT1_TITLE: Level up the Tier 1 resource planet
TUT_IMPORT1_ACT1_TEXT: <<|
	Colonize a source of [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::3;22/] Food[/b] and [b][img=ResourceClassIcons::4;22/] Water[/b],
	and export them to the tier 1 resource planet.
>>

TUT_IMPORT2_TITLE: Colonizing and Exporting
TUT_IMPORT2_TEXT: <<|
	Now that you've provided the resources for your planet to start becoming [b]Level 1[/b], its population will start growing. When the population level reaches the amount required for the level up, it will start producing its resource and export it to Spacewood per your earlier queued order.

	To reach Level 1, your planet needs to grow to [b][img=$Population;22/] 2 population[/b].
>>
TUT_IMPORT2_ACT1_TITLE: Level Spacewood to level 2
TUT_IMPORT2_ACT1_TEXT: <<|
	Finish leveling up Spacewood to [b]Level 2[/b] by waiting for the population on your Tier 1 resource planet to grow.
>>

TUT_EXPAND_SUCC_TITLE: Success!
TUT_EXPAND_SUCC_TEXT: <<|
	Congratulations! You provided Spacewood with the resources needed for it to
	become a Level 2 world.

	When you select a planet, you can see its current level and the required
	imports to level it up on the information panel in the bottom left.

	Many resources have particular [b]special effects[/b], separate to their contribution to planet levels. Be sure to read their short descriptions in the bottom left information panel, or hover over it to show a more detailed description.

	Decide carefully which planets and resources to invest in leveling up to gain their benefits!
>>

TUT_BUDGET_TITLE: Budget Cycles
TUT_BUDGET_TEXT: <<|
	Building, purchasing and maintaining things costs
	[b][color=#d1cb6a][img=ResourceIcon::0;20/] Money[/color][/b].

	Money, like most resources, is produced by your civilian population and
	infrastructure. The higher a planet's population, the more money it makes.
>>
TUT_BUDGET2_TITLE: Budget Cycles
TUT_BUDGET2_TEXT: <<|
	Your income is budgeted along 3-minute [b]Budget Cycles[/b]. Every cycle,
	your budget is re-calculated and you will gain use of any money you netted,
	to spend over the next 3 minutes.

	Any money not spent at the end of a budget cycle will instead be spent on
	one of the welfare options you can choose in the resource bar.

	It is not possible to save money from one budget cycle to the next, but
	borrowing money as an advance from an upcoming cycle is possible, at
	a hefty markup.
>>

TUT_BUILD_TITLE: Building a Scout
TUT_BUILD_TEXT: <<|
	We should build a scout to check out what's going on in Xaste, another
	system neighbouring Spacewood. The enemy may be trying to sneak in another
	FTL gate.

>>

TUT_BUILD2_TITLE: Reinforcing a Fleet
TUT_BUILD2_TEXT: <<|
	Note how the Scout design indicated it would cost [img=ResourceIcon::0;20/]
	§39k / §36k. The first number indicates its [b]Build Cost[/b] is §39k,
	which you will need to spend immediately from your available budget. The
	second number is its [b]Maintenance Cost[/b], the §36k will be subtracted
	as a maintenance cost from each subsequent budget.

	While we wait for our Scout to finish constructing, lets order some
	additional [b]Support Ships[/b] for our original Battleship's fleet.
>>
TUT_BUILD2_ACT1_TITLE: Exit Planet Management

TUT_SCOUT_TITLE: Scouting Xaste
TUT_SCOUT_TEXT: <<|
	Great! The fleet will automatically order its queued support groups from
	any nearby planets with labor generation. Different flagships can support
	differing amounts of supports, as indicated by the [b]"Support Capacity"[/b]
	indicator above the supports list.

	While our fleet is being reinforced, we'll want to send our scout to take
	a peek at the enemy.
>>
TUT_SCOUT_ACT1_TITLE: Scout Xaste
TUT_SCOUT_ACT1_TEXT: <<|
	Send your newly constructed scout to the Xaste system. Use its hyperdrive
	if you want to.
>>

TUT_CONQ_TITLE: Conquering Xaste
TUT_CONQ_TEXT: <<|
	Our scout has detected an enemy colony in the Xaste system, occupying
	a Phasite planet. Phasite is a level 0 resource that gives Research.

	Since there don't seem to be any major defense fleets around, we should
	send in our fleet to take the planet by force: Kill the planet's own
	defense ships, then lay siege to it with your fleet to reduce its loyalty.
	When its loyalty is completely drained, the planet will be yours!
>>
TUT_CONQ_ACT1_TITLE: Jump Battleship into Xaste
TUT_CONQ_ACT1_TEXT: Jump your Battleship fleet into the Xaste system using its hyperdrives.

	In order to use the Phasite it is producing and start generating research, export it to Spacewood.
>>
TUT_CAPT_ACT1_TITLE: Export Phasite
TUT_CAPT_ACT1_TEXT: Export Xaste IV's Phasite to Spacewood.

TUT_PRES_TITLE: Resources and Pressures
TUT_PRES_TEXT: <<|
	In addition to planets requiring particular types of resources to level up,
	resources can provide their consuming planet with [b]Pressure[/b].

	Civilian population on the planet will automatically develop [b]Civilian
	Buildings[/b] on the planet's surface to produce the type of pressure being
	imported (one of Money, Influence, Energy, Research, Defense, or Labor).

	Planets can only support a limited amount of pressure, dependent on their
	total population. Importing more pressure than a planets capacity will
	result in lost production efficiency.
>>

TUT_BLD_TITLE: Imperial Buildings
TUT_BLD_TEXT: <<|
	Although most of your production will be from civilian infrastructure, it
	is possible to spend parts of your budget on constructing [b]Imperial
	Buildings[/b] on planet surfaces.

	These buildings generally cost a lot of money to build and maintain, but
	can give benefits that you would not otherwise be able to get.

	Every ship you build, flagship or support ship, is based on a design. In
	order to build ships equipped with our recently unlocked Bulkhead,
	we need to change one of our designs to use it.
>>
TUT_DSG_ACT1_TITLE: Open Heavy Carrier
TUT_DSG_ACT1_TEXT: From the designs tab, [b]click[/b] the Heavy Carrier design in order to edit it.
TUT_DSG2_TITLE: Subsystems
TUT_DSG2_TEXT: <<|
	Every ship design consists of [b]subsystems[/b]. Subsystems can consist of
	any number of hexes, and can be painted in any shape on the design. The
	larger the size of a subsystem, the better it is relative to the other
	subsystems on the design.

	Some subsystems have 'core' hexes: gun turrets, engine exhausts, etc.

	If a core hex is destroyed in combat, the entire subsystem shuts off until it is repaired.
>>
TUT_DSG3_TITLE: Adding Armor
TUT_DSG3_TEXT: <<|
	Let's make the Heavy Carrier a bit more heavily armored by adding some
	plate armor hexes to protect its core hexes.

TUT_DSG4_TITLE: Modifiers
TUT_DSG4_TEXT: <<|
	In addition to adding subsytems, it is also possible to add [b]Subsystem Modifiers[/b] inside particular subsystems. These are things like bulkheads and targeting sensors, and can improve or alter the statistics of a subsystem.

	Be wary though, adding multiple modifiers to a subsystem can make it extremely expensive to build.

	intervals, new cards are added to the right side of the stack, and cards
	will drop off and disappear from the left side.

	Diplomatic actions become cheaper to purchase the longer they spend in the
	influence stack, but be careful of waiting too long to buy attractive cards
	- other empires may snatch them up first!
>>
TUT_INF3_TITLE: Purchasing an Action
TUT_INF3_TEXT: <<|
	We want to see what our enemy, the Xu'sio is up to in this region.

TUT_VOTE_TITLE: Influence Votes
TUT_VOTE_TEXT: <<|
	Certain diplomatic actions require you to pass [b]Votes[/b] in the galactic
	senate in order for them to take effect. Annexing a system is one of these votes.

	All votes have a current [b]Support Level[/b], indicating the sum of all
	their support reduced by their opposition. Most of the time, a vote will
	start at +1 support.

	Empires can pay influence to play [b]Support Cards[/b] into a vote,
	increasing or reducing the support level or adding various special effects.
>>
TUT_VOTE2_TITLE: Passing a Vote
TUT_VOTE2_TEXT: <<|
	While an influence vote, or "Proposition", has a positive support level,
	its green bar will fill up and a remaining time to [b]Pass[/b] the proposition is shown.

	When the support level is negative, any progress on the green bar is first
	removed, then the red bar fills up. When the remaining time to fail hits
	0 seconds, the vote will be [b]Rejected[/b].

	Influence votes are a diplomatic tug-of-war that any empire in the galactic
	senate can influence the result of.
