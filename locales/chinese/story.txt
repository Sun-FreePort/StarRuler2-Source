SCEN1_DESC: <<|
	[b]纪元 3277 年:[/b]
	A new coalition - the Gevron Initiative - has recently formed with the goal
	of protecting its members from the hostility of newly discovered races. Their
	desire for security has twisted their interactions from self defense to
	proactive destruction.

	The Initiative discovered a new and powerful enemy, the Nevillin Empire.
	Though a peaceful race, the Nevillin's attempts at communication were ignored,
	and war was brought to their space.

	The Nevillin Empire discovered an unstable wormhole and has been using to
	expand into a distant, isolated region of space. The Initiative's paranoia refuses
	to allow any colony to survive outside its control.

	[i]科洛将军:[/i]

	Rear Admiral, you've been assigned control of a new batallion, the 5th Navy.
	We've recently gained control of an unstable wormhole the Nevillin have been
	sending military vessels and civilians through. You are to lead the 5th
	through the wormhole to determine the strength of those forces, and conquer
	any civilian occupied space.

	We've deployed a scout and a small fleet through the wormhole. More will be on the way
	as we can spare them. Treat this as a detached engagement - minimize losses.

SCEN1_CONQUER_TITLE: Conquer and Destroy
SCEN1_CONQUER_TEXT: <<|
	You must destroy the Nevillin military, and capture its colonies.

	Engage smaller forces to minimize damage and losses, as well as to maintain supply necessary
	for sieging their worlds.

	New fleets will arrive periodically through the wormhole in Varkus.

	Excellent work, Admiral. We no longer have to worry about the Nevillin sneaking up
	from behind in the middle of the war. Unfortunately, the war back home isn't going as well.
	You're being brought back immediately, along with the 5th. With our forces bolstered,
	things should turn around quickly.

	[i]高级指挥部:[/i]

	Welcome to Varkus, Commander.
	Until the wormhole is fully stabilized, these communiques will be rare and brief.
	You�ll be commanding the new colony on Varkus III, a rare planet perfectly suited to our species.

	We need you to establish a sizeable construction infrastructure in this system.
	There are plenty of common metals available in Varkus,
	and the nearby star systems likely have other valuable resources as well.

	[i]高级指挥部:[/i]

	Commander, we are at war. A previously unknown empire has begun raiding outlying colonies,
	and a larger force buildup has been detected. Their scouts know of the wormhole and
	we can no longer consider this a safe trade lane. We're cancelling the stabilization project
	until the region has been secured.
